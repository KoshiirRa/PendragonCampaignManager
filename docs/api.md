# API

FastAPI generates the authoritative OpenAPI document at `/openapi.json` and interactive documentation at `/docs`.

The first slice exposes:

- campaign list, create, read, update, and archive;
- session list, create, and update within a campaign;
- timeline event list and create, with optional in-game year filtering;
- dice-log creation.

Historical timeline events and dice logs intentionally have no update or delete endpoints. Corrections are appended as superseding events.
